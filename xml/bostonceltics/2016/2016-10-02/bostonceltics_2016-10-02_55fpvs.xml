Each player was wearing a home jersey with Ortiz's name and number in the back. They all took selfies and got their jerseys signed by Big Papi too, which I though was pretty cool.

Overall it was a classy move on their part to show up in full force on a Saturday night and support the city the way they did. Kudos to those guys, definitely a good group of people.<comments><comment created_utc="1475364215.0" edited="False" gilded="0" id="d8a4yf3" num_reports="" parent_id="t3_55fpvs" controversiality="0">[C's honoring Pierce... err, I mean Big Papi!] (https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Ctt6uqwWIAAeTgC.jpg)</comment><comment created_utc="1475364005.0" edited="False" gilded="0" id="d8a4tu4" num_reports="" parent_id="t3_55fpvs" controversiality="0">BOSTON SPORTS &lt;3</comment><comment created_utc="1475364699.0" edited="False" gilded="0" id="d8a58mt" num_reports="" parent_id="t3_55fpvs" controversiality="0">Here's a vid of them congratulating David Ortiz for a stellar career: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eiwRjK-nsEo</comment><comment created_utc="1475385127.0" edited="False" gilded="0" id="d8agr1r" num_reports="" parent_id="t3_55fpvs" controversiality="0">Now that I have lived in cities other than Boston I really do appreciate the brotherhood among the different teams.

I'm still seething over that loss and the fact that it happened right during the Celtics coming out on Fenway made it worse. I would have liked to see the Red Sox ceremony, but I was too busy watching a shitty ending to a football game. </comment><comment created_utc="1475432913.0" edited="False" gilded="0" id="d8b23f6" num_reports="" parent_id="t1_d8aq8x0" controversiality="0">My bad man.
