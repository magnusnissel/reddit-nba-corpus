SG - Bradley, Smart, Green, Rozier Hunter/Young

SF - Crowder, Brown, Green, Young

I just don't see how he's even going to get the minutes</comment><comment created_utc="1475364832.0" edited="False" gilded="0" id="d8a5beg" num_reports="" parent_id="t3_55c0s0" controversiality="0">Yeah he'll be a big boost for a team in Turkey.</comment><comment created_utc="1475306532.0" edited="False" gilded="0" id="d89cpqx" num_reports="" parent_id="t3_55c0s0" controversiality="0">It's him or rj right? Young will have to show a lot to prove he's worth the risk over hunter's upside. Haven't heard much about either yet though</comment><comment created_utc="1475355373.0" edited="False" gilded="0" id="d89zcw5" num_reports="" parent_id="t3_55c0s0" controversiality="0">He will bring us the big fish in a trade, if that's what you mean</comment><comment created_utc="1475358516.0" edited="False" gilded="0" id="d8a1cwm" num_reports="" parent_id="t3_55c0s0" controversiality="0">I mean, he said he's trying to model his game after Paul George, so that's great.

I still don't see him ever doing anything of consequence in the NBA.</comment><comment created_utc="1475339193.0" edited="False" gilded="0" id="d89ox9y" num_reports="" parent_id="t3_55c0s0" controversiality="0">Been feeling that way the last two years, I really hope the kid can finally make an impact this year </comment><comment created_utc="1475320117.0" edited="False" gilded="0" id="d89g7i9" num_reports="" parent_id="t1_d89c1s8" controversiality="0">Real aggressive, had a nice assist to Amir on a fast break and actually helped spark a run for the team when he was subbed in.</comment><comment created_utc="1475352031.0" edited="False" gilded="0" id="d89x5k4" num_reports="" parent_id="t1_d89c1s8" controversiality="0">Here's the real answer: He looked lost and still can't dribble.</comment><comment created_utc="1475327523.0" edited="False" gilded="0" id="d89in1a" num_reports="" parent_id="t1_d89cpqx" controversiality="0">Depends on how you view the Jackson signing. There is a possible scenario where both RJ and Young are still on the team. </comment><comment created_utc="1475328283.0" edited="False" gilded="0" id="d89iymd" num_reports="" parent_id="t1_d89cpqx" controversiality="0">Hunter's upside is almost nonexistent. </comment><comment created_utc="1475321968.0" edited="False" gilded="0" id="d89gpl9" num_reports="" parent_id="t1_d89g7i9" controversiality="0">Now we're talking, didn't watch the game, but it's great to hear he's being more aggresive. I somewhy really want Young to succeed, with us..</comment><comment created_utc="1475357257.0" edited="False" gilded="0" id="d8a0ko4" num_reports="" parent_id="t1_d89x5k4" controversiality="0">He had one nice drive to the hoop. Drove at one of the bigs (Zeller maybe?), missed the layup but sprung up quickly to get the board and the lay-in. That was a promising series.


I was impressed with what he was doing, more so than RJ for sure. </comment><comment created_utc="1475332658.0" edited="False" gilded="0" id="d89l1if" num_reports="" parent_id="t1_d89iymd" controversiality="0">He can be a solid rotational player. Has a good BBIQ. Is an above-average passer. All he needs to do is start draining some threes and he can carve out a serviceable NBA career. 

It's like everyone on this sub forgot the flashes of potential he displayed last season after a so-so performance in the Summer League. </comment><comment created_utc="1475338569.0" edited="False" gilded="0" id="d89oitm" num_reports="" parent_id="t1_d89gpl9" controversiality="0">He's outplayed R.J. so far. It's not saying much because R.J. was a non factor but Young has looked somewhat competent.</comment><comment created_utc="1475358511.0" edited="False" gilded="0" id="d8a1cs4" num_reports="" parent_id="t1_d8a0ko4" controversiality="0">That I agree with. RJ is a nobody out there unfortunately.</comment></comments></submission>
